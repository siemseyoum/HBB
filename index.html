                            <p>This photograph is taken in a low angle to make the players appear taller. The type of emotion I am trying to evoke is the sense of power. The sport requires the players to maintain a fit healthy lifestyle and I wanted to show that on my photo. First, I had to consider using the rule of third and apply it on the player as well as the ball and hoop. To accomplish this task, I used dark environment to highlight the message behind the photo and used low depth of field to help direct the audience's attention on the important part.

                            <p>My second photography was inspired by Ryan Mcvay who used a black background with a high shutter speed to capture the moment of a ball going through the hoop. This image showed the concertation and skill that is required to play the sport. The black background allowed the hoop net to stand out and direct the persons attention to these specific objects. I used flash with low aperture number to allow enough light in. I used a low angle to make the hoop ring taller and bigger.

                            <p>This photograph was by inspired by Platon Antoniou who uses black and white to photography to explain the message behind the photo. I used black and white technique to capture the whole environment as it is the best format that suits all the style of photography. It also blocks out any distraction the photo has to offer. I used highest iso I could possibly get with a small number of apertures. I also used the filter option in the canon 80D which allows me to change any additional light that comes with flash.

                            <p>This photography was inspired by Christian Petersen who used a close-up image of if a player to express the mental focus and strategies that goes inside the players head. I took similar approach with the type of shot however I used black and white technique with a dark background. I took the image from the back of the player to give the audience a different perspective.

                            <p>This photography was inspired by Ward Robert who uses a simple and plain looking photograph to explain his story of a calm city. I took inspiration from one of his basketball court photos containing a graffiti and a worn-out net to represent the street ball. My idea shared similarities with the photo and decided to take a hoop without a net. I placed the object right at the middle to draw attention. The grainy look of the image makes the photo more urban style and neighbourhood friendly.

                            <p>This photography was inspired by Richard James Daniels who used a street photography in the Philippines to show the friendly and welcoming people in the photo. The message is that basketball Is an international language that can be played anywhere. My photograph shows the sport is fun even in a poor and vandalized state. I captured this moment by allowing details like the state of the environment to catch the attention of the viewer. I used a tripod to make it steady with wide shot leaving more room
